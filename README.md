# travis-env [![NpmVersion](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/travis-env.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/travis-env)

A tool to manage a shared set of travis environment variables between github repos.

## Motivation

Travis doesn't support organization wide configurations for environment variables. As a result a simple tool is needed to minimize the per-repo configuration necessary.
